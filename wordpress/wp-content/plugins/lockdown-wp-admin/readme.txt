Lockdown WP Admin conceals the administration and login screen from intruders. It can hide WordPress Admin (/wp-admin/) and and login (/wp-login.php) as well as add HTTP authentication to the login system. We can also change the login URL from wp-login.php to whatever you'd like: /login, /log-in-here, etc.

== Description ==

This plugin will hide WordPress Admin (/wp-admin/) when a user isn't logged in. If a user isn't logged in and they attempt to access WP Admin directly, they will be unable to and it will return a 404. It can also rename the login URL.

Also, you can add HTTP authentication directly from WP Admin and add custom username/password combinations for the HTTP auth or use the WordPress credentials.

This doesn't touch any .htaccess files or change the WordPress core files. All the CSS/Images under /wp-admin/ are still accessible, just not the .php ones.

If you enable HTTP authentication, it will add HTTP authentication to the PHP files in /wp-admin/.

To contribute to the development, check out [the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/srtfisher/Lockdown-WPAdmin).

== Installation ==
1. Upload `/lockdown-wp-admin/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the "Lockdown WP" menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can we add files to the white list to hide from the public eye? We want to have AJAX and use a custom file, but we can't because it hides it from the public. =

You can add a file using the 'no_check_files' filter. Use this:
	`
	function add_my_cool_filter($data)
	{
		// You have to accept the $data argument or else it will cause a system meltdown ;)
		$data[] = 'my-file-name.php';	//	JUST the file name.
		return $data;
	}
	add_filter('no_check_files', 'add_my_cool_filter');
	`

Simple.

= How can I get back in if Lockdown WP Admin locked me out? =

You can create a .txt file named 'disable_auth.txt' in your `wp-content/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/` folder (The file location would be `/wp-content/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/disable_auth.txt`). We don't care about the content but that will disable the HTTP Auth and whatever was locking you out of your site.
